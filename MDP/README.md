# Reinforcement Learning - MDP 

## Overview
This repository contains implementations for various reinforcement learning algorithms demonstrated through solutions to selected problems. These solutions aim to illustrate concepts such as policy evaluation, value iteration, and temporal difference learning.

## Contents
- **Problem 1**: Implementation of Policy Evaluation for the Frozen Lake environment using given reward functions.
- **Problem 2**: Application of the Value Iteration method to determine the optimal policy for the Frozen Lake environment.
- **Problem 3**: Policy Iteration algorithm implementation and its efficiency comparison to brute force methods in solving Markov Decision Processes (MDP).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `gym`

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib gym
